# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enterprise IT Management Agent is a comprehensive desktop application built with C# WPF and .NET 8+ that serves as a unified automation and management system for enterprise environments. Each installation acts as a self-configuring node that handles email management, distributed backup, file sharing, remote support, office document editing, printer configuration, WhatsApp-based ticketing, PBX integration, and automatic system provisioning. The application is designed to run on 100-200 Windows machines across an organization, providing centralized management capabilities while maintaining local functionality.
